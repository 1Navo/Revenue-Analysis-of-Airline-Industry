# Airline Revenue Analysis 

## Introduction:

Our company operates a diverse fleet of aircraft and provides high-quality air transportation services to our clients. However, we are currently facing challenges due to stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices, and a tight labor market resulting in increased labor costs. These factors have put pressure on our profitability, and we are seeking ways to address this issue. In order to increase profitability, we are conducting an analysis of our database to identify opportunities to improve our occupancy rate, which can boost the average profit earned per seat.

## Main Challenges
#### Stricter environmental regulations: 
The airline industry faces growing demands to decrease its carbon footprint, resulting in more stringent environmental laws that raise operating costs and restrict expansion potential.

#### Higher flight taxes: 
Governments worldwide are imposing heavier taxes on flights to address environmental concerns and increase revenue, which raises the cost of flying and decreases demand.

#### Tight labor market resulting in increased labor costs: 
The shortage of trained personnel in the aviation sector has led to increased labor costs and higher turnover rates.

## Objectives
#### Increase occupancy rate: 
By increasing the occupancy rate, we can boost the average profit earned per seat and mitigate the impact of the challenges we're facing.

#### Improve pricing strategy: 
We need to develop a pricing strategy that takes into account changing market conditions and customer preferences to attract and retain customers.

#### Enhance customer experience: 
Providing a seamless and convenient experience for our customers, from booking to arrival, will differentiate us in a highly competitive industry and increase customer loyalty.

## Basic Analysis
We conducted a basic analysis of the data, focusing on the number of planes with more than 100 seats, changes in the number of tickets booked and total revenue earned over time, and average fares for each aircraft with different fare conditions. These findings will help us develop strategies to increase occupancy rates and optimize pricing for each aircraft.

## Analysis of Ticket Bookings and Revenue
We analyzed the trend of ticket bookings and revenue earned over time using a line chart visualization. We observed a gradual increase in ticket bookings from `June 22nd to July 7th`, followed by a relatively stable pattern until August, with a noticeable peak in ticket bookings on a single day. The revenue earned by the company closely follows the number of tickets booked. Exploring the factors contributing to the peak in ticket bookings can help increase overall revenue and optimize operational strategies.

## Analysis of Fare Conditions
We generated a bar graph comparing average costs associated with different fare conditions for each aircraft. The graph shows data for three types of fares: `business, economy, and comfort`. Across all planes, the charges for business class consistently exceed those for economy class, irrespective of fare conditions.

## Analysis of Occupancy Rate
We analyzed the average occupancy per aircraft to measure how successfully we fill our seats and identify opportunities to boost occupancy rates. Higher occupancy rates can increase revenue and profitability while reducing operational expenses associated with vacant seats. Factors such as `pricing strategy, airline schedules, and customer satisfaction` can influence occupancy rates.

## Potential Increase in Total Annual Turnover
We assessed how much our total annual turnover could increase by providing all aircraft a `10% higher occupancy rate`. This analysis helps us understand the financial impact of boosting occupancy rates. Optimizing pricing strategies and other operational considerations can enhance occupancy rates, revenue, and customer value.

## Conclusion
Analyzing revenue data such as total revenue per year, average revenue per ticket, and average occupancy per aircraft is crucial for maximizing profitability. By identifying areas for improvement and optimizing pricing and route plans, airlines can enhance their revenue and profitability. It is important to strike a balance between profitability, customer satisfaction, and safety regulations. Adopting a data-driven strategy for revenue analysis and optimization can lead to long-term success in the highly competitive airline
